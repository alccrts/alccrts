### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alec, welcome to my portfolio!

I'm currently exploring the world of data analytics and steadily teaching myself various technical skills such as SQL, Python, R Studio and Data Viz.  There is much here now, but I will use this Github page to document my experiments and progress.

I am particularly excited about gaining analytical experience in the tech and media industries.
