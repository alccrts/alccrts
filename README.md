### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alec, welcome to my new portfolio!

I'm currently exploring the world of data analytics and steadily teaching myself various technical skills such as SQL, Python, R Studio and Data Viz.  I am particularly excited about gaining analytical experience in the tech and media industries.  I will use this Github page to document my experiments and progress.
