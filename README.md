### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alec, welcome to my portfolio! 

I'm currently exploring the world of data analytics and steadily teaching myself various technical skills such as SQL, Python, R Studio and Data Viz.  I will use this Github page to document my experiments and progress.  I am particularly excited about gaining analytical experience in the tech and media industries.  

#### ðŸ“š Highlights so far:

- [Python Project Euler solutions](https://github.com/alccrts/Python_Projects/tree/main/Project_Euler_Solutions)

I have completed the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/intl/ALL_ca/certificates/data-analytics/#?modal_active=none) and I'm studying Python via the University of Helsinki's 'Intro & Advanced Progamming' course.
